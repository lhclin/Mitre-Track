# Mitre-Track
Parametric Modular Mitre Track

This project is inspired by Table Saw T-Track Slider Bar / Rail by Jason (https://www.printables.com/model/57806-table-saw-t-track-slider-bar-rail).

So the dimension I created is very close to Jason's.

Basically I need some modifications to Jason's slider. Namely:
- Better fit to the screws I have (#5)
- Can connect multiple sliders together
- Has a bracket option to help mounting

For each track, user can specify the followings:
- How the front of the slider looks like (flat, round, dovetail, screw profile)
- How the end of the slider looks like (flat, dovetail, bracket)

Flat is just flat.
Round provides a round front for easier insert into the track.
The dovetails are for connecting multiple sliders together. Front dovetails are always female. End dovetails are always male.
Screw profile is for test prints to check how the screw holes fit to the screws.
Bracket is for creating a bracket at the end of the slider.

I am making the slider print without support, but there is no guarantee.

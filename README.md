# Mitre-Track
Parametric Modular Mitre Track

This project is inspired by Table Saw T-Track Slider Bar / Rail by Jason (https://www.printables.com/model/57806-table-saw-t-track-slider-bar-rail).

So the dimension I created is very close to Jason's.

Basically I need some modifications to Jason's slider. Namely:
- Better fit to the screws I have (#5)
- Can connect multiple sliders together
- Has a bracket option to help mounting

For each track, user can specify the followings:
- How the front of the slider looks like (flat, round, dovetail, screw profile)
- How the end of the slider looks like (flat, dovetail, bracket)
- Length of the slider
- Distance between drilled holes

Flat is just flat.

Round provides a round front for easier insert into the track.

Dovetails are for connecting multiple sliders together. Front dovetails are always female. End dovetails are always male.

Screw profile is for test prints to check how the screw holes fit to the screws.

Bracket is for creating a bracket at the end of the slider.

Number of drilled holes are always odd so there will always be a centre hole. Holes too closed to the edge of sliders are culled.

I am making the slider print without support, but there is no guarantee.
